# Workout Tracker
This application can be used for a user to view, create and track daily workouts. They can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise they input - If the they select a cardio exercise, it will track their distance traveled instead. The Data is stored using MongoDB with models being created with mongoose.
